# Electronics_Onboarding
A set of onboarding exercises for new members to familiarize themselves with the basics of hardware and firmware design


## Hardware Design
A key component of the HPVDT electronics team's work is Hardware design. Printed circuit boards(PCBs) are used to create embedded systems that fetch, interpret, and display important sensor information to the rider or the land crew. To create these PCBs, our team currently uses [Kicad](Kicad.com), a free and open-source software available on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

To learn about hardware design you can begin by clicking on the folder "Hardware Design".

## Firmware Design

Once our hardware has been designed and fabricated, many of our systems use microcontroller chips that interpret readings from sensors on board. To learn about firmware design you can click on the folder "Firmware Design".
