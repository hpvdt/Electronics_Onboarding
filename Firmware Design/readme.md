# Firmware OnBoard
### Aryan Ghosh

The OnBoard is an embedded system with several common perhipheral devices that you will see in HPVDT vehicles. Speed sensors, LED displays, and USB-C communication are just a few of the peripherals on this board.

This board serves as a sandbox for you to practice and improve your firmware development skills.
